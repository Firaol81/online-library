				In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning 
                over in my mind ever since.<br></br>
				
				“Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in 
                this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”

				He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I 
understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all 
judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of 
not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality 
when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of 
being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men.

				Most of the 
confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity 
when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the 
horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express 
them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter 
of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father 
snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled 
out unequally at birth.

				About half way between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs 
beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a 
valley of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque 
gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a 
transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. 
Occasionally a line of gray cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak, and comes 
to rest, and immediately the ash-gray men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an 
impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.

				 But above the gray 
land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the 
eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their irises 
are one yard high. They look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow 
spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them 
there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal 
blindness, or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, 
under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.
